# derfabiannn personal Project Repository

## This Repo contains some of my scripts or programs, which I might use on a daily basis.

#### [chrome_update.sh](https://github.com/derfabiannn/projects/blob/1dfe7781109182ee746a1cbab1eee9552547e136/chrome_update.sh)
On execution this shellscript automatically downloads the newest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/) for Ubuntu, depackages and starts it. Finally the downloaded [.deb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)) file will be deleted, since its no longer needed!

#### [check_hash.sh](https://github.com/derfabiannn/Projects/blob/19988104dd67c08caad90b21a87eaa8a4eacc44f/check_hash.sh)
On execution this shellscript calculates the [SHA 256 Hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) of a given file and compares it to the provided hash. This might come handy when you need to confirm the authenticity of a file download.

#### More projects might follow soon!
